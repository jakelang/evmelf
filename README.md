# evmelf
Small utility to translate ELF-format EVM binaries generated by [evm-llvm](https://github.com/etclabscore/evm_llvm).
It is intended to mimic Solidity's combined-json output format, used by various DAPP dev toolchains.
It currently only supports the equivalent of solc's `bin` option, but will be extended as evm-llvm provides more support.
